## functional programming
* a style of building structure , elements that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions
* avoids changing state and mutable data.
* a declarative paradigm (expressions, declarations).
* th output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function.
  1. origins in **lambda calculus** ??
  1. imperative programming
  1. logic programming
## parameters 

* nay characteristic that can help in defining, classifying a system, object, ... an element of a system that is useful ehn identifying the system or evaluating perfomance status condition
* a sysytem modelded by equations the values that decribe the sysytem are called parameters
* csn be definedd as a reference or value that is passed to a function, procedure ,
* For example, the name of a file, (a parameter), is passed to a computer program, which then performs a specific function; that is, a program may be passed the name of a file on which it will perform the specific function.
* For example, in the definition of a function such as

y = f(x) = x + 2,
x is the formal parameter (the parameter) of the defined function.

When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

f(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,
* n logic, the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate are called parameters by some authors (e.g., Prawitz, "Natural Deduction"; Paulson, "Designing a theorem prover"). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called variables. This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate variables, and when defining substitution have to distinguish between free variables and bound variables. **predicate to state or affirm or assert something about the subject or an argument of a proposition.**
## Argument 
* intended to determine the degree of truth of another statement or the conclusion.
* Logic is the study of the forms of reasoning in arguments and the development of standards and criteria to evaluate arguments.[6] Deductive arguments can be valid or sound: in a valid argument, premisses necessitate the conclusion, even if one or more of the premisses is false and the conclusion is false; in a sound argument, true premisses necessitate a true conclusion. Inductive arguments, by contrast, can have different degrees of logical strength: the stronger or more cogent the argument, the greater the probability that the conclusion is true, the weaker the argument, the lesser that probability.[7] The standards for evaluating non-deductive arguments may rest on different or additional criteria than truthâ€”for example, the persuasiveness of so-called "indispensability claims" in transcendental arguments,[8] the quality of hypotheses in retroduction, or even the disclosure of new possibilities for thinking and acting.[9]
* While arguments attempt to show that something was, is, will be, or should be the case, explanations try to show why or how something is or will be.
